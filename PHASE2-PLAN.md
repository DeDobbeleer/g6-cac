# Phase 2: Director Integration Plan

**Status**: 🚧 In Progress  
**Branch**: `phase2`  
**Start Date**: 2026-02-27  
**Last Updated**: 2026-03-03  
**Goal**: Connect to Director API, implement plan/apply commands

---

## Overview

Phase 2 implements the core deployment functionality:
- Director API provider (HTTP client with authentication)
- Plan command (dry-run, shows diff)
- Apply command (actual deployment with name-to-ID resolution)
- Name-to-ID translation during apply

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Director Provider (`src/cac_configmgr/providers/`)

```
providers/
├── __init__.py
├── base.py              # Abstract Provider interface
├── director.py          # DirectorProvider implementation
└── conventions/         # API Convention implementations
    ├── __init__.py
    └── director.py      # DirectorAPIConvention
```

**Features:**
- [x] Authentication (token-based)
- [x] Pool UUID management
- [x] HTTP client (httpx)
- [x] Resource CRUD operations
- [x] Async operation polling
- [x] Error handling and retries
- [x] API Convention abstraction (ADR-011)

### 2. Plan Command (`src/cac_configmgr/cli/`)

**Features:**
- [ ] Load declared state from YAML
- [ ] Fetch actual state from Director API
- [ ] Calculate diff (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE)
- [ ] Output: Table or JSON
- [ ] Exit codes for CI/CD integration

### 3. Apply Command (`src/cac_configmgr/cli/`)

**Features:**
- [ ] Execute plan
- [ ] Name-to-ID resolution (GET resources → build lookup)
- [ ] Handle async operations (polling)
- [ ] Progress reporting
- [ ] Error handling with rollback option
- [ ] Auto-approve flag for CI/CD

### 4. Name-to-ID Resolution

**Implementation:**
```python
# During apply phase:
1. GET /routingpolicies from Director
2. Build lookup: {"rp-default": "586cc3ed...", ...}
3. Transform: routing_policy: "rp-default" → "586cc3ed..."
4. POST to Director with real IDs
```

## Technical Design

### Provider Interface

```python
class Provider(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def get_resources(self, resource_type: str) -> list[dict]:
        """Fetch all resources of a type from Director."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def create_resource(self, resource_type: str, payload: dict) -> dict:
        """Create a resource, return response with _id."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def update_resource(self, resource_type: str, id: str, payload: dict) -> dict:
        """Update a resource."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def delete_resource(self, resource_type: str, id: str) -> None:
        """Delete a resource."""
        pass
```

### Name-to-ID Resolution

```python
class NameToIDResolver:
    def __init__(self, provider: Provider):
        self.provider = provider
        self._cache: dict[str, dict[str, str]] = {}
    
    async def build_lookup(self, resource_type: str) -> dict[str, str]:
        """Build name→ID lookup for a resource type."""
        resources = await self.provider.get_resources(resource_type)
        return {r["name"]: r["_id"] for r in resources}
    
    def resolve(self, resource_type: str, name: str) -> str:
        """Resolve a name to ID."""
        if resource_type not in self._cache:
            raise ValueError(f"Lookup not built for {resource_type}")
        return self._cache[resource_type][name]
```

### Plan Command Flow

```
1. Parse arguments (--fleet, --topology)
2. Load declared state (resolution engine)
3. Connect to Director (provider)
4. Fetch actual state (GET all resources)
5. Calculate diff:
   - In declared, not in actual → CREATE
   - In both, different → UPDATE
   - In actual, not in declared → DELETE
6. Output diff table
```

### Apply Command Flow

```
1. Parse arguments (--auto-approve?)
2. Load declared state
3. If not auto-approve, show plan and confirm
4. Connect to Director
5. Build name→ID lookups
6. Transform payloads (names → IDs)
7. Execute in dependency order:
   a. Create repos
   b. Create routing policies
   c. Create normalization policies
   d. Create enrichment policies
   e. Create processing policies (with resolved IDs)
8. Handle errors (rollback on failure)
```

## Dependencies

New dependencies (add to `pyproject.toml`):
```toml
[project.dependencies]
httpx = "^0.28.0"          # HTTP client
anyio = "^4.0.0"           # Async support
```

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Provider with mocked HTTP responses
- Name-to-ID resolver
- Diff calculation
- Payload transformation

### Integration Tests
- Against test Director instance
- Full workflow: validate → plan → apply
- Error scenarios (network failure, API errors)

### Manual Testing
- Demo configs (Bank A, Bank B)
- Real Director instance (staging)

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Director API unavailable | High | Mock provider for testing |
| Async operation timeout | Medium | Configurable timeout + retry |
| Name collision | Medium | Validation in Phase 1 |
| Network failures | Medium | Retry with exponential backoff |

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Director Provider connects and authenticates
- [ ] Plan command shows accurate diff
- [ ] Apply command deploys resources
- [ ] Name-to-ID resolution works correctly
- [ ] Error handling with rollback
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Demo configs deploy successfully

## Relationship with DirSync

### What We Learn FROM DirSync (Knowledge Transfer)

DirSync provides valuable **domain knowledge** about LogPoint Director:

| Aspect | What DirSync Teaches Us | How We Use It |
|--------|------------------------|---------------|
| **API Behavior** | Endpoints, payloads, error codes | Documented in `API-REFERENCE.md` |
| **Authentication** | Token-based auth, pool management | Implemented in `DirectorProvider` |
| **Async Patterns** | Polling strategies, timeouts | Implemented with `httpx` and `anyio` |
| **Field Mapping** | Required/optional fields, defaults | Validated in Pydantic models |
| **Error Handling** | Retry patterns, rate limits | Implemented with exponential backoff |

### What We Do NOT Copy FROM DirSync (Architecture Differences)

**DirSync Architecture (Legacy):**
```python
# ❌ Stateful, monolithic, synchronous
class DirSync:
    def sync(self):
        # Complex state management
        # Direct database connections
        # Tight coupling to specific use case
```

**CaC-ConfigMgr Architecture (Modern):**
```python
# ✅ Stateless, layered, async
class DirectorProvider(Provider):
    async def get_resources(self, resource_type: str) -> list[dict]:
        # Clean HTTP client
        # Async operations
        # Testable with mocks
```

### Key Differences

| Aspect | DirSync | CaC-ConfigMgr |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Paradigm** | Stateful synchronization | Stateless configuration as code |
| **Architecture** | Monolithic | 4-layer clean architecture |
| **Configuration** | Internal JSON | YAML with Kubernetes style |
| **Inheritance** | None | 6-level template hierarchy |
| **Validation** | Runtime basic | 4-level offline validation |
| **Approach** | Imperative | Declarative |
| **Extensibility** | Hard to extend | Provider pattern, multi-API |

### Why Clean Implementation?

1. **Different Use Cases**: DirSync synchronizes existing configs; CaC-ConfigMgr deploys desired state
2. **Different Paradigms**: DirSync is imperative; CaC-ConfigMgr is declarative with templates
3. **Technical Debt**: DirSync has legacy patterns not suitable for modern CaC
4. **Testability**: Clean architecture enables proper unit testing
5. **Future-Proof**: Provider pattern allows multiple backends (Director, Direct, future APIs)

### Implementation Rule

> **Use DirSync for "WHAT" (API contracts, payloads, errors)**  
> **Use CaC-ConfigMgr architecture for "HOW" (code structure, patterns, interfaces)**
